Scalability

Scalability KPI 
    => ThroughtPut for large number of requests
    => Latency for large number of requests

What we need actually
    => Fast read 
    => Fast processing 
    => Fast write 

How can we do 
    => Distributing load 
        => load balancer  
    => Scaling number of pods based on usage 
        => Auto Horizontal Scaler 
    => Scaling memory resources 
        => Give flag for min max cpu memory resources 

How would you design a system to handle millions of requests per second?
How do you ensure your system is horizontally scalable?

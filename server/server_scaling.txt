Load Balancer

Features 
    => If one server goes down, it pools new server from server pool 
    => It distributes the load across servers 
    => If load increases, it creates new server from server pool
    => User is able to access public IP of load balancer 
    => Server have private IP, only access within same network of servers accessible by load balancer, not visible to public

Abstract Class 

When to use 
    => You have common logic that can be shared among subclasses.
    => You want to partially implement behavior and force subclasses to implement certain methods.

=> Use an Interface when:
    => You want to enforce a contract across multiple unrelated classes.
    => You need multiple inheritance of behavior (since Java supports multiple interface implementations but only single inheritance).
    
Differences
    => 1. Abstract class
    => 2. Interface
Method Implementation	
    => Can have both implemented and abstract methods.	
    => Only abstract methods (before Java 8). Java 8+ supports default methods.
Multiple Inheritance	
    => A class can extend only one abstract class.	
    => A class can implement multiple interfaces.
Fields (Attributes)	
    => Can have instance variables.	
    => Only constants (static final).
Constructor	
    => Can have a constructor.	
    => Cannot have a constructor.

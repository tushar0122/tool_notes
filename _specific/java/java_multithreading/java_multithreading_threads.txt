Threads

Creating a thread 
    => Thread class 
    => Runnable interface

Thread class 
    => It can be created by extending the Thread class and overriding its run() method
    => If the class extends the Thread class, the thread can be run by creating an instance of the class and call its start() method:

Runnable interface
    => Another way to create a thread is to implement the Runnable interface
    => If the class implements the Runnable interface, the thread can be run by passing an instance of the class to a Thread object's constructor and then calling the thread's start() method:

Join method 
    => join() method is generally used to pause the execution of a current thread unless and until the specified thread on which join is called is dead or completed. To stop a thread from running until another thread gets ended, this method can be used. It joins the start of a thread execution to the end of another threadâ€™s execution. It is considered the final method of a thread class.

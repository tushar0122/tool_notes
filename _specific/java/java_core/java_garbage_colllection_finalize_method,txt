Finalize Method 
    => The Java finalize() method of Object class is a method that the Garbage Collector always calls just before the deletion/destroying the object which is eligible for Garbage Collection to perform clean-up activity. Clean-up activity means closing the resources associated with that object like Database Connection, Network Connection, or we can say resource de-allocation. Remember, it is not a reserved keyword. Once the finalize() method completes immediately, Garbage Collector destroys that object.

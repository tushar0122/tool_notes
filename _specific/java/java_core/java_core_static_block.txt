Static Block 
    =>  Java supports a special block, called a static block (also called static clause) that can be used for static initialization of a class. This code inside the static block is executed only once: the first time the class is loaded into memory. 

Calling static block 
    => Now comes the point of how to call this static block. So in order to call any static block, there is no specified way as static block executes automatically when the class is loaded in memory. 
    => A class can have any number of static initialization blocks, and they can appear anywhere in the class body. The runtime system guarantees that static initialization blocks are called in the order that they appear in the source code.

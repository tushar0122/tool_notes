Garbage Collection
    => Garbage collection is basically a process of managing memory automatically. It uses several GC algorithms among which the popular one includes Mark and Sweep. The process includes three phases i.e., marking, deletion, and compaction/copying. In simple words, a garbage collector finds objects that are no longer required by the program and then delete or remove these unused objects to free up the memory space.

Static Class 

Nested Class 
    => Java allows a class to be defined within another class. These are called Nested Classes. 

Outer Class 
    => The class in which the nested class is defined is known as the Outer Class. 

Static class 
    => At top level only one class can be static 
    => Unlike top-level classes, Nested classes can be Static. 
    => A static nested class may be instantiated without instantiating its outer class
    => A static class can access only the static members of the outer class.

Inner Class
    => Non-static nested classes are also known as Inner classes.
    => An instance of an inner class cannot be created without an instance of the outer class.
    => Therefore, an inner class instance can access all of the members of its outer class, without using a reference to the outer class instance. For this reason, inner classes can help make programs simple and concise. 
    => Inner classes can access both static and non-static members of the outer class.

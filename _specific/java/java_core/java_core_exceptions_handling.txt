Exceptions Handling
    => Exception handling in Java is an effective mechanism for managing runtime errors to ensure the applicationâ€™s regular flow is maintained. Some Common examples of exceptions include ClassNotFoundException, IOException, SQLException, RemoteException, etc. By handling these exceptions, Java enables developers to create robust and fault-tolerant applications.

2. What are Java performance best practices you follow?
Answer:

Use StringBuilder instead of String concatenation in loops.

Avoid unnecessary object creation.

Use efficient data structures (e.g., ArrayList vs LinkedList, HashMap vs TreeMap).

Apply lazy initialization where possible.

Optimize SQL queries in case of DB interaction.

Tune thread pools, connection pools.

3. What are some JVM options for performance tuning?
Answer:

-Xms, -Xmx: Set initial and max heap size.

-XX:+UseG1GC: Use G1 Garbage Collector for better performance on large heaps.

-XX:+PrintGCDetails, -Xlog:gc*: Log GC info.

-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError: Dump heap on OOM

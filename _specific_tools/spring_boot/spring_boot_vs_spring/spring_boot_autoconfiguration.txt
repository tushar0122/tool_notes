AutoConfiguration
It’s a feature in Spring Boot that automatically configures your application based on the libraries and settings you have on your classpath.

For example, if you include spring-boot-starter-web, Spring Boot will auto-configure an embedded Tomcat server, Spring MVC, and other web settings without you writing any XML or Java config.

Auto-configuration saves you from manually setting up beans, data sources, transaction managers, and more. It “just works” based on what dependencies you add.

You can still override or customize these auto-configurations by defining your own beans or using properties.

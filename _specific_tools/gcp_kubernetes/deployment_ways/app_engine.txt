App Engine is a fully managed platform for running apps without worrying about infrastructure, ideal for simple web apps and APIs.

It handles scaling, load balancing, and deployments automatically with minimal configuration.

Kubernetes gives you full control to run complex, containerized apps with custom networking, storage, and scaling.

But Kubernetes requires managing clusters and more DevOps effort compared to App Engineâ€™s easy serverless experience.

Kubernetes lets you run complex, stateful apps with persistent storage and custom networking.

It supports multi-container pods, long-running background jobs, and hardware access like GPUs.

Cloud Run only runs stateless, single-container apps triggered by HTTP requests.

Cloud Run is fully managed with no infra control, so it canâ€™t handle advanced workloads Kubernetes can.

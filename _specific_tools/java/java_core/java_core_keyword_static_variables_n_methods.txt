Static Variables Methods 
    => The static keyword is used to share the same variable or method of a given class. 

Static Variables
    => Static variables are the variables that once declared then a single copy of the variable is created and shared among all objects at the class level.
    => Static variable can call by directly with the help of class only, we do not need to create object for the class in this.

Static Methods 
    => Static methods have access to class variables (static variables) without using the class’s object (instance).
    => In a static environment, this and super aren’t allowed to be used.
    => They cannot be overridden as they use static binding at compile time.
    => If both superclass and subclass have static methods with the same name, it is called Method Hiding, where the subclass method hides the superclass method.


Why main method is static 
    => It’s because calling a static method isn’t needed of the object. If it were a non-static method, JVM would first build an object before calling the main() method, resulting in an extra memory allocation difficulty.


Instance method 
    => It can access all attributes of a class.	
    => By default, all the instance methods in Java are considered as the Virtual function except final, static, and private methods

Strings 
    => Strings are immutable in java 

Ways of creating String 
    => There are two ways to create a string in Java: 
        => String Literal
        => Using new Keyword 

String literal 
    => To make Java more memory efficient (because no new objects are created if it exists already in the string constant pool).
    => It is preferred to use String literals as it allows JVM to optimize memory allocation.

Using new keyword  
    => new String("text"); explicitly creates a new and referentially distinct instance of a String object; String s = "text"; may reuse an instance from the string constant pool if one is available.
    
String Pool 
    => In Java, string literals are stored in a special area of memory called the string pool (also known as the string literal pool or intern pool). The string pool is a part of the heap memory, and it is managed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

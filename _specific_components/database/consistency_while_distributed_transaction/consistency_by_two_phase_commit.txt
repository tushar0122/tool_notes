Used for:
ðŸ“¦ Distributed Transactions (ensuring atomicity across multiple databases or services)

Goal:
To make sure all participating systems in a transaction either commit or rollback together â€” no partial commits.

Phases:

Prepare Phase:
The coordinator sends a prepare message to all participants.
Each participant responds with ready to commit or abort.

Commit Phase:
If all say ready, the coordinator sends commit.
If any say abort, it sends rollback to all.

Pros:
Ensures atomicity across systems.

Cons:
Blocking: If coordinator crashes, participants may wait indefinitely.
Not fault-tolerant unless enhanced (e.g., 3PC, Paxos, etc.).

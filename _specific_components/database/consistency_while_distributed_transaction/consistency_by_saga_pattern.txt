Saga Pattern 
    => Each Microservice has it's own database 
    => One transaction need to write in multiple database 
    => If fails need to rollback in all

Two ways 
    => Orchestrator 
        => Send events to database if one is sucessfully 
        => If failure rollback all
    => each Microservice by self send events

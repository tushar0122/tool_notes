SQL
    => Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %
    => Comparison Operators: =, !=, <>, >, <, >=, <=
    => Logical Operators: AND, OR, NOT
    => Set Operators: UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT
    => Special Operators: BETWEEN, IN, LIKE, IS NULL


UNION
    => The UNION operator combines the result sets of two or more SELECT queries into a single result set, removing duplicate rows. This is useful when we need a consolidated view of data from multiple tables or queries that have similar structure.

UNION ALL
    => Includes all rows from each query, including duplicates.
    => Performance-wise, UNION ALL is faster because it doesnâ€™t require an additional step to remove duplicates.

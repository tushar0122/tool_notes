Temporary Table 
    => Temporary tables are tables that exist only for the duration of a session or a transaction. They are useful for storing intermediate results, simplifying complex queries, or performing operations on subsets of data without modifying the main tables.

1. Local Temporary Tables:

Prefixed with # (e.g., #TempTable).
Only visible to the session that created them.
Automatically dropped when the session ends.
2. Global Temporary Tables:

Prefixed with ## (e.g., ##GlobalTempTable).
Visible to all sessions.
Dropped when all sessions that reference them are closed.

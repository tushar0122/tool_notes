CAP Theoram 
    => CAP theorem states it is impossible for a distributed system to simultaneously provide more
    than two of these three guarantees: consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. Let us
    establish a few definitions.

Consistency
    => consistency means all clients see the same data at the same time no matter
    which node they connect to.
Availability
    => availability means any client which requests data gets a response even if some
    of the nodes are down.
Partition Tolerance
    => a partition indicates a communication break between two nodes.
    Partition tolerance means the system continues to operate despite network partitions

Database server 
    => D1 
    => D2 
    => D3
    => D1 not D2 
        => CP 
            => Block write operations in all nodes
    => D1 not D2 
        => AP 
        => Continue (Consistency lost)
        => Read Write Continues 
        => Data Synced after partition resolved
    => CA
        => If partition occurs whole system down 
        => Not realistic

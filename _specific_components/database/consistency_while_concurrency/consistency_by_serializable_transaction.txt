Two Phase Locking
    => Read 
        => Multiple read can be done
        => Write is blocked 
    => Write 
        => All read and write is blocked

Serializable Snapshot Isolation 
    => Pessemisstic Locking
        => Lock when writing row level 

Serializable using optimistic concurrency
    => Optimistic Locking
        => Using versioning
        => Check for conflict and abort
        => Reject if conflict occurs
        => No locking

Usecase 
    => Good for read heavy system

Pros 
    => No locking
    => High latency 

Cons 
    => Not suitable for high conflicting scenarios

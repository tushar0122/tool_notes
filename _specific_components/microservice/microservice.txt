1. What are upstream and downstream services in microservices architecture?
Answer:

Upstream service: A service that sends data or triggers a request to another service. It's the source of information.

Downstream service: A service that receives data or a request from another service. It consumes the output of the upstream service.

‚ùì2. Can a microservice be both upstream and downstream?
Answer:
Yes. A microservice can act as:

Upstream for one service (sending requests)

Downstream for another (receiving requests)

üìå Example:

Payment Service is downstream to Order Service

But upstream to Notification Service for payment success messages.

‚ùì3. How do you handle failures in downstream services?
Answer:
To handle downstream failures:

Use Circuit Breaker (e.g., Netflix Hystrix, Resilience4j)

Implement Retries with backoff

Use Fallbacks to return default responses

Monitor downstream health with heartbeat checks

Use timeouts to avoid waiting too long

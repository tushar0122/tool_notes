Data Center 
    => A data center is a facility used to house computer systems and associated components, such as:
        => Servers
        => Networking equipment (switches, routers, firewalls)
        => Power supplies
        => Cooling systems
        => Storage systems
        => Physical security
    
Advantage
    => In the event of any significant data center outage, we direct all traffic to a healthy data center.

GeoDNS Routing 
    => In normal operation, users are geoDNS-routed, also known as geo-routed, to the closest data center, with a split traffic of x% in US-East and (100 â€“ x)% in US-West. geoDNS is a DNS service that allows domain names to be resolved to IP addresses based on the location of a user.

Several technical challenges must be resolved to achieve multi-data center setup:
    => Traffic redirection
        => Effective tools are needed to direct traffic to the correct data center.
        GeoDNS can be used to direct traffic to the nearest data center depending on where a user
        is located.
    => Data synchronization
        => Users from different regions could use different local databases or
        caches. In failover cases, traffic might be routed to a data center where data is unavailable.
        A common strategy is to replicate data across multiple data centers. A previous study
        shows how Netflix implements asynchronous multi-data center replication [11].
    => Test and deployment
        => With multi-data center setup, it is important to test your
        website/application at different locations. Automated deployment tools are vital to keep
        services consistent through all the data centers [11].

To further scale our system, we need to decouple different components of the system so they
can be scaled independently. 
Messaging queue is a key strategy employed by many realworld distributed systems to solve this problem.

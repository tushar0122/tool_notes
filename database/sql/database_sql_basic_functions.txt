Aggregate Functions
    => Aggregate functions perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value. Common aggregate functions include:
COUNT()
    => Returns the number of rows.
    => Counts the number of rows or non-NULL values in a column
SUM(): Returns the total sum of values.
AVG(): Returns the average of values.
MIN(): Returns the smallest value.
MAX(): Returns the largest value.

Scaler Functions 
    => Scalar functions operate on individual values and return a single value as a result. They are often used for formatting or converting data. 

LEN(): Returns the length of a string.
ROUND(): Rounds a numeric value.
CONVERT(): Converts a value from one data type to another.

COALESCE Function 
    => The COALESCE function returns the first non-NULL value from a list of expressions. Itâ€™s commonly used to provide default values or handle missing data gracefully.

NVL()
    => Replaces a NULL value with a specified replacement value.

NVL2()
    => Evaluates two values:
    => If the first argument is NOT NULL, returns the second argument.
    => If the first argument is NULL, returns the third argument.

RANK()
    => Assigns a rank to each row, with gaps if there are ties.
    => If two employees have the same salary, they get the same rank,DENSE_RANK()
    => Assigns consecutive ranks without any gaps.

ROW_NUMBER()
    => Assigns a unique number to each row regardless of ties.
    
RANK()
    => Assigns the same number to tied rows and leaves gaps for subsequent ranks.

Window Functions 
    => A window function in SQL is a type of function that allows us to perform calculations across a specific set of rows related to the current row. These calculations happen within a defined window of data, and they are particularly useful for aggregates, rankings, and cumulative totals without altering the dataset.
    => SQL window functions can be categorized into two primary types: 
        => aggregate window functions 
        => ranking window functions

Aggregate window functions
    => Aggregate window functions calculate aggregates over a window of rows while retaining individual rows. These include SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), MAX(), and MIN().

Ranking window functions 
    => These functions provide rankings of rows within a partition based on specific criteria. Common ranking functions include:    
    => 1. RANK() Function
    => 2. DENSE_RANK() Function
    => 3. ROW_NUMBER() Function

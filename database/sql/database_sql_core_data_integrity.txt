Data integrity
    => Data integrity refers to the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of the data stored in the database. SQL databases maintain data integrity through several mechanisms:

Constraints
    => Ensuring that certain conditions are always met. For example, NOT NULL ensures a column cannot have missing values, FOREIGN KEY ensures a valid relationship between tables, and UNIQUE ensures no duplicate values.
Transactions
    => Ensuring that a series of operations either all succeed or all fail, preserving data consistency.
Triggers
    => Automatically enforcing rules or validations before or after changes to data.
Normalization
    => Organizing data into multiple related tables to minimize redundancy and prevent anomalies.

These measures collectively ensure that the data remains reliable and meaningful over time

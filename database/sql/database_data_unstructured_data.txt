Unstructured Data 
    => Unstructured data refers to data that does not have a predefined model or format. It is typically not organized in a way that fits into traditional databases, making it harder to analyze and process with conventional tools.

Characteristics of Unstructured Data
    =? Lack of Schema: No predefined structure or format.
    => Complexity: Can contain a mix of text, multimedia, or other formats, making analysis challenging.    
    => Volume: Often large in size, as it includes raw or primary data.
    => Storage: Typically stored in data lakes, object storage systems (like AWS S3), or distributed file systems.
    => Processing: Requires specialized tools like Natural Language Processing (NLP), image recognition algorithms, or big data platforms (e.g., Hadoop, Apache Spark).

Examples of Unstructured Data
    => Text-Based:
        => Emails (body content, attachments)
        => Chat messages
        => Social media posts (tweets, comments)

        => Images (JPG, PNG, etc.)
        => Videos (MP4, AVI)
        => Audio files (MP3, WAV)
    => Logs:
        => Machine or server logs
        => Event logs
    => Web Content:
        => Web pages
        => Blogs
        => PDFs

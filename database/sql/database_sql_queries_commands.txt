DDL 
    => These commands are used to define and modify the structure of database objects such as tables, indexes, and views. For example, the CREATE command creates a new table, the ALTER command modifies an existing table, and the DROP command removes a table entirely. DDL commands primarily focus on the schema or structure of the database.

DML 
    => These commands deal with the actual data stored within database objects. For instance, the INSERT command adds rows of data to a table, the UPDATE command modifies existing data, and the DELETE command removes rows from a table. In short, DML commands allow you to query and manipulate the data itself rather than the structure.

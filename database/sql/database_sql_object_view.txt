View 
    => A view is a virtual table created by a SELECT query. It does not store data itself, but presents data from one or more tables in a structured way. Views simplify complex queries, improve readability, and enhance security by restricting access to specific rows or columns.

Standard View:
    => A virtual table defined by a query.
    => Does not store data; the underlying query is executed each time the view is referenced.
    => A standard view shows real-time data.

Materialized View:
    => A physical table that stores the result of the query.
    => Data is precomputed and stored, making reads faster.
    => Requires periodic refreshes to keep data up to date.
    => materialized view is used to store aggregated sales data, updated nightly, for fast reporting.

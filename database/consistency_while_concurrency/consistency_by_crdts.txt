CRDT's 
    => CRDTs work by designing data structures and operations in such a way that all updates can be applied in any order, and replicas will still converge to the same state.

This is possible by enforcing mathematical properties like:

Commutativity: a + b = b + a (order doesn't matter)
Associativity: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) (grouping doesn't matter)
Idempotency: applying the same update multiple times has no further effect.

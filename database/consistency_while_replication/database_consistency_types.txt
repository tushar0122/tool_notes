Before jumping into methods, understand the levels of consistency:

Strong Consistency
Every read returns the latest write (like a single-node DB).

Eventual Consistency
All nodes will eventually converge to the same state.

Causal Consistency
    => Preserves the cause-effect relationship.
    => Casual consistency (often confused with causal consistency) is a consistency model used in distributed systems, especially in databases and distributed caches, to manage how updates are seen by different nodes or clients.
    => Stronger than eventual consistency

Read-Your-Writes Consistency
    => A client always sees its own updates.
    => âœ… If a client writes data, any subsequent reads by that same client will reflect that write.
 

Session Consistency
    => Guarantees within a session, not globally.

Anti Entropy 
    => Anti-entropy is about healing inconsistencies between nodes by comparing and reconciling data periodically â€” like syncing up your phone and cloud to ensure both have the same photos.

There are several strategies for anti-entropy:

Merkle Trees (Hash Trees)
Nodes compare compact tree representations of their data.
Only the parts that differ are synced.

Used in: Amazon DynamoDB, Cassandra

Gossip Protocols
Nodes randomly select peers and exchange state information.
Over time, all nodes converge to a consistent state.

Used in: Riak, Scuttlebutt

Read Repair
During reads, if inconsistencies are found, the node repairs data by writing the correct version.
On-the-fly consistency fix.

Hinted Handoff
Temporarily stores updates for unavailable nodes and hands them off when they recover.

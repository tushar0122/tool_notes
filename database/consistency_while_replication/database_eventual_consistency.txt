Use Quorum-Based Reads and Writes
A quorum is the minimum number of nodes in a distributed system that must agree (respond) to a read or write operation to consider it successful.
If:
N = total number of replica nodes for a data item
W = number of replicas that must acknowledge a write
R = number of replicas that must respond to a read
This inequality ensures that:

There is at least one replica that has the latest write and is guaranteed to be part of every read quorum.

Here’s how it works:

✅ Write Path
A write is sent to all N replicas.
Only W replicas need to acknowledge it for the write to be considered successful.
These W replicas now hold the latest version of the data.

✅ Read Path
A read request is sent to all N replicas.
Only R replicas need to respond.
If R + W > N, then at least one node that acknowledged the latest write will also be in the read quorum.
Therefore, that node can serve the latest data (or help the system detect and reconcile stale data).

Service discovery
    => The primary role of service discovery is to recommend the best chat server for a client based
    on the criteria like geographical location, server capacity, etc. Apache Zookeeper [7] is a
    popular open-source solution for service discovery. It registers all the available chat servers
    and picks the best chat server for a client based on predefined criteria.

Logging
    => When working with a small website that runs on a few servers, logging, metrics, and
    automation support are good practices but not a necessity. However, now that your site has
    grown to serve a large business, investing in those tools is essential.

Advantage
    => Logging: 
        => Monitoring error logs is important because it helps to identify errors and problems
        in the system. You can monitor error logs at per server level or use tools to aggregate them to
        a centralized service for easy search and viewing.
    => Metrics
        => Collecting different types of metrics help us to gain business insights and understand
        the health status of the system. Some of the following metrics are useful:
        • Host level metrics: CPU, Memory, disk I/O, etc.
        • Aggregated level metrics: for example, the performance of the entire database tier, cache
        tier, etc.
        • Key business metrics: daily active users, retention, revenue, etc.
    => Automation
        => When a system gets big and complex, we need to build or leverage automation
        tools to improve productivity. Continuous integration is a good practice, in which each code
        check-in is verified through automation, allowing teams to detect problems early. Besides,
        automating your build, test, deploy process, etc. could improve developer productivity
        significantly.

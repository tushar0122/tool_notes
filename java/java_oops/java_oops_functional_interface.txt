Functional Interaface
    => A functional interface in Java is an interface that contains only one abstract method. Functional interfaces can have multiple default or static methods, but only one abstract method. 
    => Runnable, ActionListener, and Comparator are common examples of Java functional interfaces. From Java 8 onwards, lambda expressions and method references can be used to represent the instance of a functional interface.

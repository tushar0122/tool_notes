Automatically Sign In without entering credentials  
    => This is typically achieved using authentication tokens, cookies, and session management. 

Remember Me 
    => When you check "Remember Me" during login, the system generates a long-lived authentication token.
    => This token is stored in a cookie or local storage in the browser.
    => When you revisit the site, the system detects this token and automatically logs you in.

Session cookies 
    => When you log in, the server creates a session and stores a session ID in a cookie.
    => As long as the cookie is valid, your browser sends it with every request, keeping you logged in.
    => If the session expires (e.g., after a few hours or days), you need to log in again.

JWT 
    => Some applications use JWT-based authentication.
    => After login, a JWT token is issued and stored in local storage or session storage.
    => This token is sent with each request to authenticate the user without needing credentials again.

OAuth & Single Sign On (SSO)
    => Websites like LeetCode may allow login via Google, GitHub, or Facebook.
    => They use OAuth to authenticate you and store a refresh token that can get new access tokens.
    => This allows automatic sign-in without re-entering credentials.

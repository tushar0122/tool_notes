Reliability: 
    => Measured often in uptime percentages.
Availability: 
    => Can be measured using uptime metrics, such as "five nines" (99.999%).
Security: 
    => Can be evaluated using penetration testing results, compliance indicators, security frameworks adhered to, and specific security protocols' success rates

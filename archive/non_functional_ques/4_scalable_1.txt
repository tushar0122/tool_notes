How would you design a system to handle millions of requests per second?

Designing a system to handle millions of requests per second requires a scalable, fault-tolerant, and highly available architecture. Below is a high-level design approach:

1. Load Balancing
    => Use Global Load Balancers (GLB) (e.g., AWS Route 53, GCP Load Balancer) to distribute traffic across regions.
    => Deploy Layer-7 Load Balancers (e.g., Nginx, Envoy, HAProxy) to route traffic intelligently.
    => Implement Layer-4 Load Balancers (e.g., AWS ALB/NLB, Google Load Balancer) for TCP-level optimization.

2. Scalable API Gateway
    =. Use API Gateways like Kong, Apigee, or AWS API Gateway to handle authentication, rate limiting, and caching.
    => Integrate Web Application Firewall (WAF) to prevent DDoS attacks.

3. Distributed Caching
    => Deploy Redis or Memcached for frequently accessed data, reducing load on databases.
    => Implement Content Delivery Networks (CDN) like Cloudflare or AWS CloudFront to cache responses globally.

4. Asynchronous Processing
    => Use Message Queues (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ, AWS SQS) to decouple services and ensure high throughput.
    => Implement Event-Driven Architecture using Apache Kafka or Google Pub/Sub.

5. Database Optimization
    => Choose NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB) for high write throughput.
    => Use Sharding & Partitioning (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL with Citus, or MongoDB) to distribute data across nodes.
    => Implement Write-Behind Caching and Read Replicas for better database performance.
    => Use Graph Databases (e.g., Neo4j) for relationship-heavy queries.
    => Store immutable transactions in Ledger Databases (e.g., AWS QLDB, Hyperledger).

6. Compute & Scalability
    => Use Microservices architecture for independent scaling.
    => Deploy Kubernetes (K8s) or Docker Swarm for auto-scaling and service orchestration.
    => Implement Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions) for event-driven scaling.

7. High-Performance Data Processing
    =>  Use Apache Spark or Flink for real-time data stream processing.
    => Implement Apache Hadoop for large-scale batch processing.

8. Security & Fault Tolerance
    => Implement Rate Limiting & Throttling to prevent abuse.
    => Use Multi-Region Failover & Disaster Recovery to ensure system availability.
    => Deploy Circuit Breaker Pattern (e.g., Hystrix) to prevent cascading failures.

9. Observability & Monitoring
    => Implement Logging & Monitoring using ELK Stack, Prometheus, Grafana.
    =>  Use Distributed Tracing (Jaeger, Zipkin) for debugging microservices.

10. Benchmarking & Continuous Optimization
    => Perform Load Testing using Locust, JMeter.
    => Optimize using Profiling Tools like Flame Graphs.

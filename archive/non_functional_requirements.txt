Non Functional Requirements 
    => A non-functional requirement (NFR) specifies criteria that can be used to judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviors or functions. These requirements define how a system performs a function rather than what the function is.

Key Characteristics of Non-Functional Requirements:
    => Quality Attributes: Focus on performance, reliability, usability, security, etc.
    => Constraints: Set boundaries on design or implementation (e.g., compliance with standards).
    => Measurable: Often defined with metrics (e.g., system uptime should be 99.9%).

Examples of Non-Functional Requirements:
    => Performance:
        => The system must handle 10,000 requests per second.
    => Scalability:
        => The system must scale to accommodate 1 million users.
    => Security:
        => Data must be encrypted using AES-256.
    => Availability:
        => The system should have 99.99% uptime.
    => Usability:
        => The system should be operable by a user with no training in under 10 minutes.
    => Maintainability:
        => Codebase must allow for changes with minimal effort.
    => Portability:
        => The system should run on Linux and Windows environments.
    => Compliance:
        => Must adhere to GDPR regulations for data storage and handling.

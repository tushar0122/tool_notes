Best Practices for Architectural Patterns
    => Understanding before Application: 
        => Ensure you are truly solving a problem specific to your context, and not adopting a pattern prematurely or needlessly complicating your design.

    => Design Flexibility: 
        => A good architecture allows for future changes and is not overly rigid or exhaustive without reason.

    => Code Reusability: 
        => Aim to minimize duplication by design and code reuse strategies.

    => Separation of Concerns: 
        => Each component should have a clear, singular role, and should need to understand as little as possible about the rest of the system.

    => Scalability: 
        => The architecture should be able to scale with complexity, requirements, and user load.

    => Maintainability: 
        => It should be relatively easy to debug, enhance, and maintain the system.

    => Security and Compliance: 
        => Your architecture should account for security standards in your domain, including data protection laws and best practices.

    => Clear Communication: 
        => Developers should share a consistent vocabulary to understand the architecture, especially when collaborating on the system.

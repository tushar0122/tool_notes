Transport Layer 
    => TCP/IP 
    => UDP/IP  

TCP/IP 
    => We maintain virtual Connection
    => Data packets are sent 
    => Ordering maintained 
    => Each packet is acknowleged
    => If packet is not acknowleged, again sent 

UDP/IP 
    => No Connection maintained 
    => No ordering 
    => No acknowlegement
    => Fast than TCP/IP 
    => Used in video calling, live streaming

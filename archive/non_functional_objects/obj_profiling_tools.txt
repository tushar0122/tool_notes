        => iotop: A top-like tool for monitoring disk I/O usage by processes in real time.
        => Wireshark: A network protocol analyzer that captures network packets and can help identify network-related bottlenecks.
4. Thread/Concurrency Profiling Tools
    => Purpose: These tools help track multi-threading behavior and concurrent execution, identifying issues like thread contention, race conditions, and thread synchronization problems.
    => Examples:
        => ThreadSanitizer: A runtime data race detector that is part of the LLVM project, helping developers identify and fix concurrency bugs in C++ and Rust programs.
        => Concurrency Visualizer: A tool that is part of Visual Studio for analyzing thread performance, synchronization issues, and CPU utilization in multithreaded applications.
        => Java Flight Recorder (JFR): A low-overhead tool for profiling Java applications, providing insights into thread behavior, garbage collection, I/O, and more.
5. Database Profiling Tools
    => Purpose: These tools help track and optimize database queries, identify slow queries, and ensure optimal database performance.
    => Examples:
        => MySQL Enterprise Monitor: A comprehensive monitoring solution that helps identify slow queries, database load, and optimize MySQL performance.
        => pgBadger: A fast PostgreSQL log analyzer and performance profiler, which generates detailed reports on query performance.
        => Oracle SQL Developer: Provides a profiling tool for analyzing SQL queries in Oracle databases to optimize performance.
6. Web Application Profiling Tools
    => Purpose: These tools focus on profiling web applications, including network latency, database queries, and server-side processing times.
    => Examples:
        => New Relic: A comprehensive performance monitoring tool for web applications, including front-end and back-end performance, error tracking, and database query performance.
        => Google Lighthouse: An open-source tool for auditing the performance of web pages. It provides insights into performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices.
        =. Chrome DevTools: The built-in developer tools in Google Chrome, which provide a suite of profiling tools for JavaScript performance, network analysis, and rendering performance.
        => Dynatrace: A monitoring tool that offers detailed insights into web application performance, including transaction tracing and root-cause analysis of slow response times.
7. Network Profiling Tools
    => Purpose: These tools help analyze and optimize network performance by measuring latency, throughput, and packet loss.
    => Examples:
    => Wireshark: A powerful network protocol analyzer that can capture and display network traffic, helping diagnose network-related performance issues.
    => Ping: A simple tool to measure network latency between hosts. It’s useful for identifying network delays.
    => iperf: A network testing tool that measures bandwidth and network performance between two hosts.
8. GPU Profiling Tools
    => Purpose: These tools profile GPU usage, such as rendering times, GPU memory usage, and parallel processing tasks. They are especially useful for graphics-intensive applications like games or machine learning workloads.
    => Examples:
    => NVIDIA Nsight: A suite of profiling and debugging tools for applications using NVIDIA GPUs. It includes tools for GPU performance analysis, memory usage tracking, and real-time debugging.
    => AMD Radeon™ Profiler: A tool for profiling GPU performance for applications using AMD GPUs, helping developers optimize rendering and parallel processing tasks.
    =>     => TensorFlow Profiler: A tool for profiling machine learning workloads in TensorFlow, including GPU usage and memory optimization.
    => 9. Web Browser Profiling Tools
    => Purpose: These tools help you profile the performance of web applications directly within the browser, focusing on load times, rendering performance, and resource utilization.
    => Examples:
    => Chrome DevTools: Provides a suite of tools for profiling websites, including a performance panel to analyze JavaScript execution, rendering times, and network activity.

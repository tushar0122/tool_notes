Distributed Tracing        
    => Distributed tracing is a method to track requests across microservices to identify performance bottlenecks, latency issues, and failures in a distributed system.

Why is Distributed Tracing Important?
    => End-to-End Visibility 📊: Helps track a request’s journey across multiple services.
    => Performance Optimization 🚀: Identifies slow services and bottlenecks.
    => Root Cause Analysis 🔍: Helps debug errors by correlating logs and traces.
    => Improves Observability 👀: Complements logging and monitoring for a complete view.
    => 🛠 Distributed Tracing Architecture
    => A distributed tracing system typically includes:
    => Tracing Instrumentation: Captures request traces from applications.
    => Trace Collection: Aggregates trace data in a backend system.
    => Visualization & Analysis: Displays trace dependencies and latencies.
1️. Open-Source Distributed Tracing Tools
        => 🔹 OpenTelemetry (OTel)
        => Industry-standard tracing framework.
        => Supports traces, metrics, and logs.
        => Integrates with Jaeger, Zipkin, Prometheus, and Grafana.
        => Use Case: Modern microservices observability.
        => 🔹 Jaeger
        => Open-source, built by Uber.

3️. Distributed Tracing in Kubernetes
        => Kubernetes workloads generate thousands of requests per second. These tools help trace them efficiently:
        => 
        => ✅ Prometheus + Grafana + OpenTelemetry
        => Collect traces, metrics, and logs for a unified observability stack.
        => Use Case: Kubernetes performance monitoring.
        => ✅ Istio Service Mesh + Jaeger
        => Automatically traces requests across microservices.
        => Use Case: Service-to-service tracing in Kubernetes.
        => ✅ Envoy + Zipkin
        => Envoy proxies automatically send traces to Zipkin.
        => Use Case: Tracing API Gateway and ingress traffic.

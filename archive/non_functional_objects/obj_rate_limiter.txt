Rate Limiting:

Purpose: 
    => It restricts the number of requests or actions a user or system can perform within a certain time window.

Use case: 
    => This is commonly used to prevent abuse or overload of services by ensuring that a user can only make a specific number of requests in a set period (e.g., 100 requests per minute).

Behavior: 
    => Once the rate limit is exceeded, the system will typically reject or delay further requests until the time window resets.

Example: An API that allows a maximum of 100 requests per minute per user

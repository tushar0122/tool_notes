Desirable property of distributed system with replicated data 

CAP 
C - Consistency 
A - Availability 
P - Partition Tolerance 

Distributed System
    => Multiple nodes having data distributed

Can't have all three 

CA 
    => 

CP 
    => 

AP 
    => 

Consistency
    => Node B - a=4 => a=5 
    => Node B -> Node C 
    => Node C - a=4 => a=5
    => After successful write in any node, it should read same data from any node 

Availability
    => Node B, Node C atleast respond
    => All node should respond
    => Success/Failure

Partition Tolerance
    => Node B Node C communication break 
    => Node A can still query, still A can query and getting response 

Why Not All three 
    => When Partition Tolerance means can't communication and then Consistency can't be possible itself clear 
        => Then AP is possible if we remove C 
    => Consistency
        => CP 
            => if Partition Tolerance down the inconsistent node,  Node C is done     
            => One node is down, so no Availability
        => CA 
            => Consistency will be done, if no Partition Tolerance
            => Write not allowed in case of Partition

P 
    => is very much required 
    => We can't stop system for not to write in case of Partition

C or A 
    => Choose one 
    => CP or AP

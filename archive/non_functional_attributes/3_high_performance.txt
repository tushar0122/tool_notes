Performance
    
Performance increases with 
    => Scalability

Performance KPI 
    => ThroughtPut
    => Latency

What we need actually
    => Fast read 
    => Fast processing 
    => Fast write 

How can we do 
    => parallel processing
        => multithreading 
    => using main memory for fast processing
        => caching 
    => distributing load 
        => load balancing 
        => horizontal scaling 
    => Increasing cpu and memory resources based on usages
        => Vertical Scaling

What are the key considerations when designing a low-latency system?
How do you optimize a system for high throughput?
How do you handle hotspots in a distributed database?
